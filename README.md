# ANN-Based Adaptive PID Controller for a Self-Balancing Robot

This repository contains the implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Adaptive PID Controller** for a two-wheeled self-balancing robot. The system is designed to improve stability and robustness by dynamically adjusting PID gains (**Kp, Ki, Kd**) in real time, based on the robot's current state. The ANN model is trained offline and deployed on an embedded platform using **ONNX Runtime** for efficient inference.

## Performance Summary
| Metric                     | Conventional PID | ANN-Adaptive PID |
|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Rise Time (s)              | 0.0170           | 0.0175           |
| Overshoot / Undershoot (%) | -114.35          | -75.59           |
| Peak Time (s)              | 2.72             | 4.40             |
| Steady-State Error (Â°)     | +0.3763          | -0.2381          |

The ANN-Adaptive PID shows **~34% improvement** in overshoot reduction and better damping performance compared to the conventional PID controller.
